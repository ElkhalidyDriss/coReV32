# coReV32: A Pipelined RISC-V Processor

**coReV32** is a pipelined RISC-V processor implemented in VHDL. This design includes:

- **Support for Interrupts**: Efficiently handles both internal and external interrupts.
- **Hazard Detection**: Implements mechanisms to identify and resolve data and control hazards during instruction execution.
- **Exception Handling**: Provides a robust framework for managing exceptions that may arise during operation.
- **External Interrupt Handling with PLIC**: Utilizes the Platform-Level Interrupt Controller (PLIC) to facilitate the management of external interrupts.

This project aims to deliver a high-performance and versatile processor suitable for various applications.
